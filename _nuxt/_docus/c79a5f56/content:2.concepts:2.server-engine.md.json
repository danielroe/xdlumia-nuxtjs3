This will make an API call to the server if run on the browser, but will simply call the relevant function if run on the server, **saving an additional API call**.\n\n`$fetch` API is using [ohmyfetch](https://github.com/unjs/ohmyfetch), with key features including:\n\n* Automatic parsing of JSON responses (with access to raw response if needed)\n* Request body and params are automatically handled, with correct `Content-Type` headers being added\n\nFor more information on `$fetch` features, check out [ohmyfetch](https://github.com/unjs/ohmyfetch).\n\n## Standalone Server\n\nNitro produces a standalone server dist that is independent of `node_modules`.\n\nThe server in Nuxt 2 is not standalone, but requires part of nuxt core to be involved running `nuxt start` (with the [`nuxt-start`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt-start) or [`nuxt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt) distributions) or custom programmatic usage, which was fragile and prone to breakage and not suitable for serverless and service-worker environments.\n\nThis dist is generated when running `nuxt build` into a [`.output`](/docs/directory-structure/output) directory.\n\nThe output is combined with both runtime code to run your Nuxt server in any environment (including experimental browser Service Workers!) and serve you static files, making it a true [hybrid framework](/concepts/hybrid-rendering) for the JAMStack. In addition, a native storage layer is implemented, supporting multi source, drivers and local assets.\n\n::alert{type=\"info\" icon=IconCode}\nCheckout the Nitro engine on GitHub:
