We have been doing this since October 2016, tuning all the configuration to provide the best optimization and performance for any Vue applications.\n\nNuxt takes care of all of this so you can focus on what matters: **creating your web application**.\n\nOn top of this setup, Nuxt provides a [directory structure](/docs/directory-structure/app) to follow, focused on specific features to keep your focus on creating, not configuring.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nNuxt is composed of different [core packages](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages):\n::list{type=info}\n- Core Engine: [nuxt3](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/nuxt3)\n- Bundlers: [@nuxt/vite-builder](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/vite) and [@nuxt/webpack-builder](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/webpack)\n- Command line interface: [nuxi](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/nuxi)\n- Server engine: [@nuxt/nitro](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/nitro)\n- Development kit: [@nuxt/kit](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/kit)\n- Nuxt 2 Bridge: [@nuxt/bridge](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/tree/main/packages/bridge)\n::\n\nWe recommend to read each concept to have a full vision of Nuxt capabilities and scope of each package.\n\n## Are you Nuxt?\n\nNuxt is the backbone of your Vue.js project, giving structure to build your project with confidence while keeping flexibility.\n\nExtendable with a strong module ecosystem and hooks engine, it makes it easy to connect your REST or GraphQL endpoints, favorites CMS, CSS frameworks and more.
